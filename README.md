# Lore: Collaborative Storytelling on Avalanche L1

## üåü Project Overview
Lore is an experimental blockchain that transforms transactions into collaborative art. Built as an Avalanche L1 subnet, it enables users to:
- Contribute story lines through paid transactions (LOR tokens)
- Create permanent, immutable narratives stored on-chain
- Participate in community-driven storytelling economics

**Core Features**  
‚úÖ EVM-compatible blockchain using Subnet-EVM  
‚úÖ Native LOR token for transaction fees  
‚úÖ Ordered on-chain story storage  
‚úÖ Anti-spam mechanics through token incentives  
‚úÖ Seamless integration with Ethereum tools (MetaMask, Hardhat)

curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ava-labs/avalanche-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s
echo 'export PATH=~/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Create Lore Blockchain 
```bash
avalanche blockchain create lore
```
**Configuration Options:**
- VM: Subnet-EVM
- Consensus: Proof-of-Authority (dev mode)
- Chain ID: 251200

- Controller Address: `ewoq` test key

### Deploy Locally
```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy lore --network local
```

## üîÆ Roadmap

## ü§ù Contributing

We warmly welcome contributions in the following ways:

1. Crafting and expanding the collaborative story (post-mainnet launch)  
2. Enhancing and optimizing smart contract logic and security  
3. Developing integration tools and utilities for better interaction  
4. Designing engaging community events and challenges to boost participation  

If you're passionate about storytelling, blockchain tech, or community building, your skills are invaluable here!
